[Police brutality in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States) has been an nationwide issue since the 20th century. Public safety of U.S. citizens is a typical argument to justify the controversially high number of fatal shootings.

I took [kaggle data](https://www.kaggle.com/washingtonpost/police-shootings)  and decided to analyze list of issues that follow police brutality. I thought about  multiple ideas on how to tackle these found issues. I used hypothesis testing to check if there were difference between years shooting records. I tested clustering techniques to find if there were any patterns that could signal racial descrimination. Unfortunately used clustering algorithms wasn't working with categorical data therefore I decided to make a simple logistic regression and see if there are specific circumstances were people with certain race can be shooted a bit more likely than other races.
